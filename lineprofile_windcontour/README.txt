This folder contains the wind_contour_plot.ipynb that plots the wind countour visualization and the line profile model given user defined uo and taustar parameters. It also contains the visualization_plots.ipynb that produces visual aids for understanding u_crit and x_bound; and the optical_depth_model.ipynb that plots tau vs. x at different radius.

All codes do not take input files. Remember to specify parameters R_shock and T_star in each code. The other parameters (R_star, V_inf, M_lossrate) will not affect the final plots.

Some errors are encountered when parameter beta is set to 1, or other integers.
